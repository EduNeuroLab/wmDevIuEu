# wmDevAroundBirth

This code is related to our manuscript titled "Human white matter myelinates faster in utero than ex utero". The manuscript is currently in press at PNAS. There are three different jupyter notebooks included:
The Dockerfile and notebook in the "mrtrix_pipeline" directory illustrate how we conducted tractography in the dHCP data using tools provided by MRtrix 3. The notebook "pyBabyAFQ" shows how we identified 20 white matter bundles in individual infants using the newly developed pyBabyAFQ software. PyBabyAFQ is made available as a novel component of pyAFQ (see https://github.com/yeatmanlab/pyAFQ).
The notebook "codeForMainFigures" shows how all the main statistical analyses were performed and how the main figures were created.
